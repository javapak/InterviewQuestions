# Interview Questions for eBacon

## Running the solution
1. Install Node.js LTS if you do not have it (22.18.0 at the time of writing). Previous versions should be ok too though. (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Navigate to the root (same level as package.json) of this repository after clone.
3. For first time, execute "npm run setup-run" which execs "npm i && ts-node response/TotalCompensation.ts" as defined in package.json
4. Any subsequent execution can be done with "npm run dev" so you are not running npm i every single time you execute.
